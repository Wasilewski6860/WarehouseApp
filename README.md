# WarehouseApp

<p>This project is a warehouse application.</p>
<p>The warehouse is a database with one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.</p>
<p>The database stores information about goods and their quantity in warehouses. It also stores information about users -- users can be recipients and suppliers. By receiving/supplying goods, their quantity in the warehouse changes.</p>
